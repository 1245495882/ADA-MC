In the paper “A Small Target Detection Method Based on Multibranch Convolution and Adaptive Dual Attention Module”, the code and models are placed in a folder named ADA-MC.
The ADA-MC file contains four sub-files, named 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  1 is the performance evaluation of ADAM under different channel compression ratios.
  2 is the ablation experiment of MConv. 
  3 is the detection effect on the VisDrone2019 dataset under the pre-trained weights of YOLO11. 
  4 is the code for ADAM and MConv.
